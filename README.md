# Machine Learning Algorithms

I'll be building most used algorithms of machine learning from scratch and using some libraries with the same algorithms and others usual things.

**Here they are with completed status:**
- [x] K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- [x] Linear Regression
- [ ] Logistic Regression
- [ ] Random Forest 
- [ ] Naive Bayes
- [ ] Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- [ ] Perceptron
- [ ] Support vector machines (SVM)
- [ ] KMeans
